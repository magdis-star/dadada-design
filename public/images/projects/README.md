# Project Screenshots

Add your project screenshots here!

## How to Add Your Own Screenshots:

1. **Take a screenshot** of gonzalomorales.net (and other projects)
   - Use your browser's screenshot tool
   - Or use a screenshot extension
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px (will be automatically resized)

2. **Save the file** in this folder with a clear name:
   - `gonzalo-morales.jpg`
   - `project-name.jpg`
   - etc.

3. **Update the Projects.tsx file** to use your screenshot:
   ```javascript
   image: "/images/projects/gonzalo-morales.jpg",
   ```

## Current Setup:
- Right now using a screenshot service (may need refresh to work)
- Replace with your own screenshot for best quality!
